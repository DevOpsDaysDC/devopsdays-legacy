  <h1>Talks</h1>

<h2>We are Great at DevOps but the Enterprise is Failing with Joanne Molesky</h2>

<p><img width="200" src="images/joannem.jpg"/>
<a href="../program/slides/DevOpsDaysLondon2016JMolesky.pdf">slides</a><br/>
DevOps and Continuous Delivery (CD) allow us to deliver IT services and products faster and more reliable than product owners ever dreamed of. However, many enterprise management processes and practices are barricades that require dismantling to gain maximum benefit from this capability. In this session, we will talk about legacy management practices in Finance, IT Governance and Procurement and how they inhibit our ability to extend the benefits and create more value to our customers when we embrace DevOps and CD. We will provide examples from large enterprises that demonstrate how we can use Lean Thinking and Principles to break down these management barricades and deliver even more value to our customers.</p>

<h3>About the Speaker</h3>

<p>Joanne Molesky is a Principal Associate at ThoughtWorks and is coauthor of The Lean Enterprise: How High Performance Organizations Innovated at Scale. She specializes in IT Governance, Risk and Compliance and has led our global practice team for Continuous Delivery and the internal Information Security team.</p>

<h2>Bimodal and Other Snakeoil with Kris Saxton</h2>

<p><img width="200" src="images/Kris-Saxton.jpg"/>
<a href="../program/slides/Bimodal_IT_kris_saxton_2016.pptx">slides</a><br/></p>

<p>Bimodal IT is being presented by some analysts and vendors as the strategic response to the supposedly intractable task of reforming legacy estates while continuing to innovate.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will argue that this approach is a flawed oversimplification which, when adopted, results in lost opportunities, delays crucial decisions on how we evolve our legacy systems, and ultimately cripples the very ability to innovate we seek to protect.</p>

<p>Based on the experience of 5 projects (4 within large retail or investment banks and 1 with a large reinsurer) over the past two years, we will attempt to show that agile and devops teams within large financial organisations cannot hope to succeed without dealing with legacy environments, but also provide reassurance that these teams already have everything they need to both innovate and evolve their legacy environments.</p>

<h3>About the Speaker</h3>

<p>Kris has been a UNIX systems engineer for more than 10 years, with more than half of that time spent building ISPs and ASPs. A technical authority on all things data centre, he has held CTO positions and worked on automating server estates comprised of tens of thousands of machines.</p>

<p>A London School of Economics graduate and erstwhile Mountaineer, proprietary software is his mistress, but his heart lies with open source software.</p>

<h2>Minimum Viable Platform: The 6 Characteristics of Operationally Mature Production Environments with Casey West</h2>

<p><img width="200" src="images/casew.jpg"/></p>

<p>Operational maturity for a distributed-systems production environment requires a
clear understanding of the 6 high-level characteristics common to
operationally mature production environments:</P></p>

<UL>
    <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Routing
    and load balancing</P>
    <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Backing
    services broker</P>
    <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Infrastructure
    orchestration</P>
    <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Health
    management, monitoring and recovery</P>
    <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Immutable
    artefact repository</P>
    <LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Log
    aggregation</P>
</UL>


<p>In this interactive talk, we will explore the critical capabilities necessary to create a mature production platform with these characteristics. We will present these capabilities in the form of a useful rubric for you to create your own Minimum Viable Platform effectively.</p>

<p>What's more, you will gain insights on what life is like in the day-of-the-life of teams who have the operational maturity of a Minimum Viable Platform.</p>

<h2>Let's talk about Security with Justin Cormack</h2>

<p><img width="200" src="images/justincormack.jpg"/>
<a href="../program/slides/DevOpsDaysLondon_LetstalkaboutSecurity.pdf">slides</a><br/></p>

<p>Having a conversation about security between developers, security professionals and ops requires a common language, and tools that respect that language.</p>

<p>In this talk I discuss a conversational approach to defense, in depth approaches to application security, going from a high level language about what a program is intended to do, and applying this to tools that restrict behaviours.</p>

<p>Appropriate language depends on the problem domain, so I will look at concrete examples. The first case is the OpenBSD pledge system, introduced last year. This has been the most successful rollout of a capability reduction system, with it applied to the majority of the programs in the base system within a few months. It is however successful because it targets the language of a particular problem domain, and is not necessarily directly applicable elsewhere.</p>

<p>As a second example I will look at the ongoing work we are doing at Docker to apply the pledge model to make a language for describing containerised applications, looking at the differences in the domain languages for a different type of application.</p>

<h3>About the Speaker</h3>

<p>Justin Cormack is an engineer at Docker, and co-author of Docker in Production: Lessons from the Trenches. He worked for Unikernel Systems, and now Docker in Cambridge UK. He is interested in how we can make systems software adapt to modern devops practices, as it is one of the last areas to aspire to the monolithic and slow moving</p>

<h2>My Top Five Lessons Learned: DevOps In Large, Complex Organizations with Gene Kim</h2>

<p><img width="200" src="images/2012GeneKimheadshot.jpg"/>
<a href="../program/slides/GeneKim-20160435mDevOpsDaysLondon-TopFiveLearnings.pptx">slides</a><br/></p>

<p>For me, nothing inspires more awe and more learning than studying how large, complex organizations that have been around for decades, or even centuries, are mobilizing around DevOps and getting the same amazing outcomes that we typically see in organizations like Amazon, Google, Netflix and Etsy. They are elevating the state of the engineering practice in organizations that often have thousands of development, test and operations engineers, improving organizational outcomes and making work more humane and fun.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to share with the DevOpsDays community what I’ve learned, share the problem roadmap that’s been verbalized, and some of the things we’ve been working on to help people overcome those problems!</p>

<p>See you there!</p>

<h3>About the Speaker</h3>

<p>Gene is a multiple award winning CTO, researcher and author.  He was founder and CTO of Tripwire for 13 years. He has written three books, including “The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win,” “The Visible Ops Handbook” and the upcoming “DevOps Handbook.”</p>

<p>Gene is a huge fan of IT operations, and how it can enable developers to maximize throughput of features from “code complete” to “in production,” without causing chaos and disruption to the IT environment.  He has worked with some of the top Internet companies on improving deployment flow and increasing the rigor around IT operational processes. In 2007, ComputerWorld added Gene to the “40 Innovative IT People Under The Age Of 40” list, and was given the Outstanding Alumnus Award by the Department of Computer Sciences at Purdue University for achievement and leadership in the profession.</p>

<h2>Rate of Change, (Un)opinionated Platforms and Devops Coevolution by Gareth Rushgrove</h2>

<p><img width="200" src="images/Gareth-Rushgrove.jpg"/>
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/rate-of-change-microservices-and-platforms-a-tale-of-devops-coevolution">slides</a><br/></p>

<p>There has been a recent explosion in new technologies for running software systems.</p>

<p>Many architectures are now based on ever smaller (micro) services.</p>

<p>The devops movement has crossed the chasm and become mainstream with operators and developers working more closely together than ever before.</p>

<p>These three threads are the result of coevolution - where a change in one practice has a direct effect on others.</p>

<p>Join us to gain insights on how the adoption of practices such as devops and microservices, and tools such as platform as a service, are interconnected. You'll also develop a better understanding of how devops emerged in widely different organisations. Last, but by no means least, we'll explore the power of coevolution which makes cause and effect bi-directional, making it possible to leverage what you do and how you do it to improve your organisation as a whole.</p>

<h3>About the Speaker</h3>

<p>Gareth Rushgrove is a senior software engineer at Puppet Labs. He
works remotely from Cambridge (UK) building interesting tools for
people to better manage infrastructure. Previously he worked for the
UK Government Digital Service focused on infrastructure, operations
and information security.</p>

<p>When not working he can be found writing the

<h2>Enterprise Ops Rising with Jeromy Carriere</h2>

<p><img width="200" src="images/Jeromy-Carriere.jpg"/></p>

<p>As enterprise organisations move to the cloud they are faced with numerous operational and security challenges. First, they need to manage and monitor large numbers of systems and microservices. Second, they need to ensure proper application functioning and compliance with relevant standards. Last, but by no means least, they need to do all of that in a hybrid model - bridging across infrastructure platforms and legacy applications.
In this session, we will look at the changing requirements, opportunities, and challenges for the DevOps community as enterprises move to the cloud. In particular, we will examine the intersection of ops and governance and how we see practices evolving there as well as where gaps remain. We will conclude with insights from Google's own experience deploying applications on its cloud platform.</p>

<h2>Agile your ITIL - Bringing DevOps Benefits to IT Service Management with Claire Agutter</h2>

<p><img width="200" src="images/ClaireHeadshot.jpg"/>
<a href="../program/slides/Claire.pdf">slides</a><br/></p>

<p>Many large financial enterprises have spent years implementing frameworks, standards and methodologies to try and get IT 'right'. One of the most commonly adopted of these is ITIL, enabling organisations to put in place fundamental processes such as incident management and change management.
The result of implementing of ITIL may lead to IT staff feeling overloaded and resist DevOps initiatives because they've only just 'finished' ITIL. What's more, the problem is that ITIL is typically restricted to operations while agile thinking remains exclusively limited within IT development.
In this talk, we will focus on bringing elements of agile thinking to IT service management to provide the benefits of DevOps without overwhelming an organisation and its staff. In particular, we will be looking at ways to unite dev and ops, apply agile thinking to ITSM processes and redefine what we mean by 'service' and 'product'. The result will be a better understanding of how to adopt DevOps in large organisation by evolution, not revolution.</p>

<h3>About the Speaker</h3>

<p>Claire Agutter is the director of ITSM Zone, providers of high quality e-learning for IT professionals.  Claire uses her background in service management operations and consultancy to blend old and new best practice to give organizations the toolkit they need to deliver business value.
