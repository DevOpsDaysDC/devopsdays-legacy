			<description>&lt;p&gt;The explosion of devopsdays events in recent years is exciting for everyone in the community. Some of us have been in this space since before the first event in Ghent, while others are joining with the newest events coming online in 2015. In the last year we've added new global core organizers, seen the originator of devopsdays (Patrick Debois) move into an advisory role, and been thrilled by rapid expansion in the numbers and locations of events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to host a devopsdays where you live, it's easy to get started. Devopsdays events are locally and independently run events, with assistance provided by the global core organizers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk to the members of your local devops community and get a few people together from different organizations so you have an assortment of perspectives. Then check out our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devopsdays.org/pages/organizing/&quot;&gt;organizing guide&lt;/a&gt; and drop us a line letting us know you'd like to join in!&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;h2&gt;Announcing the 2011 DevOps Days - Mt. View&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What started in Ghent in 2009 and has travelled the world from Sydney to Sao Paulo to Boston is now coming BACK to Mountain View! That's right, following on the heels of an awesome 2-day event in Boston DevOps Days is rolling into town to cap off the Velocity Conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be the seventh official DevOps Days event and it's sure to be a grand one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Save the date&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event will take place June 17th and 18th. That's a Friday and Saturday. If you're going to be in town for Velocity (or you want to come out specifically for DevOps Days) you don't want to miss this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially if you're going to Velocity, the DevOps Days format is a great way to interact with people that you might not have had otherwise. If you've never been, think of it as the Hallway track on steroids. There's no reason NOT to stay the extra two days and come experience something that could literally change your professional life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The format&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No two DevOps Days are alike. They're like Pokemonm, 'gotta attend em all!'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special care is taken to tailor the event format as a whole to fit the particulars of, not only the location and the audience, but also to the state of DevOps at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2011 Mountain View event is no exception. Where as last year was a 1 day event, we're going for two days this year. Because of the days of the week involved, we're mixing things up a bit (subject to a bit of change):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday June 17&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  This will be similar to the event last year in that we plan on having panel discussions. We're also adding a few tricks we picked up from past events, including Boston this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignite talks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Openspace (proposal period)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;  Ignite talks are a rockin' good time. You get 5 minutes and 20 slides to talk about a topic. Oh, did we mention your slides auto-advance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Open spaces are a great way to tailor the conference to what you want to hear about. Because of the sheer number of people that we expect, we're going to change things up a bit from previous open spaces. Friday will be proposal day while Saturday....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday June 18&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  This will be the day that for the actual open spaces. As with Friday, we're also bringing something along from Boston - Demo Rounds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Demo rounds were something that happened quite by accident and organically in Boston. Think of it as an Ignite presentation merged with openspace and a side of The Gong Show/Survivor. Got a cool project, you're working on? Give a demo. If the group likes it and wants you to keep going, you can. The group gets tired? Yield the floor to the next person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons for doing two days in Mountain View this year. The first is that two days is becoming the official DevOps Days format. There's simply too much wonderful information to cover that can fit in one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason, and one that we think is important enough that we are carrying over into Saturday, is based on experiences last year in Mountain View. Because we're coming off of Velocity, the crowd is simply much larger. We want to fit in as much as possible and keep with some of the basic formats that we've used elsewhere - for instance the open spaces (which are worth the price of admission alone). We simply cannot fit that into one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, again because of the expected crowd size, we're taking special pains to deal with some of the problems from last year. With such a large crowd, it was difficult for everyone to get a chance to interact with the speakers. We're working hard to factor in interaction into all the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Be there or be square&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't want to miss this. You'll meet some amazing people, learn lots of cool new stuff but also help shape the future of devops. One theme we're really focusing on hard this year is &quot;Moving the conversation forward&quot;. That doesn't mean we won't have discussions around &quot;the basics&quot; but we're ready to take it to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a chance to be a part of that discussion and help shape the face of something that is taking the information technology and business world by storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join us.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;For the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;/events/2011-mountainview&quot;&gt;DevOpsDays in Mountain View&lt;/a&gt; we're looking to create t-shirts based off of your design.  We're going to run a design submission period, followed by a brief rating period.  The design with the most votes will get printed on the back of the Devopsdays 2011 - Mountain View event shirt.  How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make the voting period safe, we'll be collecting submissions up to Midnight PDT on May 15th.  Once we have all submissions we'll create the voting apparatus at DevOpsDays.org - where interested people can vote on their favorite design.  We will close the design voting period out at Midnight PDT on May 31st - and give the design to our printer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, based on feedback from previous events we're going to go with black/dark-colored t-shirts.  Please ensure your designs accommodate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Submit an Idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you're not a great artist, you can still think of a great tagline !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.uservoice.com/forums/113611-t-shirt-design-ideas-for-devopsdays-mountain-vie&quot;&gt;Submit your idea here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Submitting A design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please use &lt;a href=&quot;tshirt-template.png&quot;&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt; when you submit your design to us - along with full-scale artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Questions/Comments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions please email us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:proposals-mountainview-2011@devopsdays.org&quot;&gt;proposals-mountainview-2011@devopsdays.org&lt;/a&gt; with any concerns/comments.&lt;/p&gt;

We're going to run a design submission period, followed by a brief rating period.  The design with the most votes will get printed on the back of the Devopsdays 2011 - Mountain View event shirt.  How cool is that?</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>In order to make the voting period safe, we'll be collecting submissions up to Midnight PDT on May 15th.  Once we have all submissions we'll create the voting apparatus at DevOpsDays.org - where interested people can vote on their favorite design.  We will close the design voting period out at Midnight PDT on May 31st - and give the design to our printer.</p>

<p>Note, based on feedback from previous events we're going to go with black/dark-colored t-shirts.  Please ensure your designs accommodate.</p>

<p>Even if you're not a great artist, you can still think of a great tagline !</p>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Another year, another devopsdays! This time in the marvelous city of Boston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;On 7 and 8 March 2011&lt;/b&gt;, we are organizing a new devopsdays. It will be a two event with conference talks in the morning and &lt;a href=&quot;/pages/open-space-format&quot;&gt;openspaces&lt;/a&gt; in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is kindly hosted by the &lt;a href=&quot;/events/2011-boston/location&quot;&gt;Microsoft NERD Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can contribute in one of the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propose a session for the conference talks:&lt;/strong&gt; it will be a 45 minute session where you can talk about the next big things happening in devops land, you're reflections on devops (good and bad), the experiences you want to share. For a detailed description see &lt;a href=&quot;/events/2011-boston/proposals&quot;&gt;our call for presentations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propose a lightning talk:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a strong devops related message that you really want to share with the DevOps world, we encourage you to send us a proposal for an Ignite presentation. These are 5 minute talks with 20 slides which auto-advance. If you aren't familiar with the format, google is your friend (and I won't question your geek cred... &lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; maybe you've just been busy... &lt;a href=&quot;http://igniteshow.com/&quot;&gt;go check some out&lt;/a&gt;, we'll still be here when you get back. ) The only rule is don't give a straight pitch.  That's not even a rule we'll enforce, everyone will just think you are lame... that is punishment enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Register and show up:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the success factor of previous devopsdays is the &lt;a href=&quot;/pages/open-space-format&quot;&gt;openspace-format&lt;/a&gt;: it fosters the sharing of ideas and insights in good old fashion, non-technical way by just talking to each other. Last time it even got people who would normally never talk, into the conversation. This doesn't require any effort besides &lt;a href=&quot;/events/2011-boston/registration&quot;&gt;registering&lt;/a&gt; and showing up at the event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsor the event:&lt;/strong&gt; We really like to keep the devopsdays a low budget maximum pleasure thing. Therefore we actively seek sponsors to make this happen. In return we hope to &lt;a href=&quot;/events/2011-boston/sponsor&quot;&gt;make it valuable for you to sponsor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hope to meet you at the &lt;a href=&quot;/events/2011-boston/&quot;&gt;devopsdays in Boston&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organizers: Vladimir Vuksan, Adam Fletcher , John Vincent , Patrick Debois&lt;/p&gt;
